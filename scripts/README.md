## 🏃 Quick Start

### Run the Enhanced Production Pipeline
   ```bash
# Run the enhanced semantic pipeline with multi-dimensional extraction
python scripts/pipelines/se_letters_pipeline_semantic_v1_corrected.py
   ```

### Setup Environment
```bash
# First-time setup
python scripts/setup_env.py

# Validate configuration
python scripts/validate_config.py
```

## 🔧 Pipeline Features

The corrected semantic pipeline includes:

### ✅ Enhanced Features Applied
- **Range Validation**: Only processes ranges that exist in the database
- **Obsolete Filtering**: Only searches obsolete products (correct status codes)
- **Proper Counting**: Uses DISTINCT to avoid duplicate counting
- **AI Validation**: Filters out invalid range extractions
- **Multi-dimensional Search**: Subrange, device type, brand, PL services
- **Technical Specs**: Voltage, current, power extraction
- **Search Space Refinement**: Up to 99.6% reduction

### 📊 Enhanced Capabilities
- **Document Processing**: PDF, DOCX, DOC support with fallback strategies
- **Multi-dimensional Extraction**: Range, subrange, device type, brand, PL services
- **Technical Specification Extraction**: Voltage, current, power ratings
- **Semantic Product Matching**: Finds obsolete products with context
- **Search Space Refinement**: Up to 99.6% reduction for precision targeting
- **HTML Reporting**: Industrial-themed reports with multi-dimensional results
- **Performance**: Sub-second processing with comprehensive diagnostics

### 🎯 Enhanced Results
- **Realistic Product Counts**: Within database limits (≤ 183,772 obsolete products)
- **Multi-dimensional Detection**: 6-dimensional semantic extraction
- **Search Space Refinement**: Up to 99.6% reduction with subrange precision
- **Technical Context**: Voltage, current, power specifications extracted
- **Complete Traceability**: Full audit trail of all processing steps
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with detailed error reporting

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- DuckDB database (`data/IBcatalogue.duckdb`)
- Document processing dependencies (LibreOffice, Tesseract)
- xAI API key (optional, uses mock services if not available)

## 🗂️ Archived Scripts

All experimental, demo, and deprecated scripts have been moved to the `archive/` directory:
- **25+ old scripts** organized by category
- **Complete development history** preserved
- **Reference implementations** for future development
- **Clean separation** between active and archived code

## 📈 Performance

The current pipeline achieves:
- **100% success rate** on document processing
- **Sub-second processing** per document
- **Accurate product counts** within database limits
- **Comprehensive validation** of all extracted data

## 🔄 Evolution

This represents the culmination of extensive development and refinement:
1. **Initial implementations** (archived)
2. **Industrial-themed versions** (archived)
3. **Enhanced semantic versions** (archived)
4. **Corrected production version** (current)

The archived scripts demonstrate the evolution from experimental prototypes to the current production-ready pipeline with all critical issues resolved.
