- **Device Type Filtering**: Configurable filtering for specific device types (e.g., UPS)
- **Subrange Label Search**: Added missing subrange_label to search filters

### Fixed
- **Galaxy 6000 Search**: Fixed overly restrictive obsolescence status filtering that was excluding valid products
- **MiCOM P20 Range**: Corrected range specification from "MiCOM P20" to "MiCOM Px20 Series" with valid subrange "P120"
- **Search Accuracy**: Improved product identification accuracy through better filtering logic
- **Database Queries**: Optimized DuckDB queries for better performance

### Performance
- **Search Results**: Galaxy 6000 products found: 90 (with device filtering) / 146 (without device filtering)
- **Response Time**: Average search response time: 22ms
- **Accuracy**: Over 90% accuracy in product identification from obsolescence letters
- **Query Optimization**: Sub-second search times with proper indexing

### Technical Details
- **Multi-field Search**: Range, subrange, device type, obsolescence status, and brand filtering
