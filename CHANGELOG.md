## [2.2.2] - 2025-07-16

### Fixed
- **Critical YAML Syntax Error**: Fixed invalid YAML syntax in `config/prompts.yaml` where `=` was used instead of `:` for key-value pairs
- **Database Search Parameter Binding**: Fixed parameter binding issue in `searchLettersWithProducts` method that caused "Values were not provided for prepared statement parameters" errors
- **Network Connectivity Issues**: Added network connectivity check and retry logic for XAI API calls to handle DNS resolution failures gracefully
- **XAI API DNS Resolution**: Implemented fallback validation when network connectivity issues prevent xAI API access

### Added
- Network connectivity validation before XAI API calls
- Exponential backoff retry logic for failed API calls
- Graceful fallback to basic validation when network issues occur
- Enhanced error logging for debugging network connectivity problems

### Changed
- Improved error handling in production pipeline service
- Enhanced database search query debugging with SQL and parameter logging
- Updated content validation to continue processing even with network issues

### Technical Details
- **YAML Fix**: Replaced all instances of `version = "2.2.0"` with `version: "2.2.0"` in prompts.yaml
- **Database Fix**: Ensured count query uses same parameters as main query in searchLettersWithProducts
- **Network Fix**: Added socket and HTTP connectivity tests before making xAI API calls
- **Fallback Logic**: Pipeline now continues with reduced confidence when network issues occur

### Testing
- ✅ YAML syntax validation passed
- ✅ Webapp build compilation successful
- ✅ Database search functionality restored
- ✅ Network connectivity checks implemented

## [2.2.1] - 2025-07-16

### Fixed
- **Search Space Filtering**: Fixed obsolescence status filtering to match exact database status codes
- **Range/Subrange Logic**: Improved handling of cases where range includes subrange (e.g., "MGE Galaxy 6000")
- **Subrange Label Filtering**: Added missing subrange_label to search filters for more precise product discovery
- **MiCOM P20 Range**: Corrected range specification from "MiCOM P20" to "MiCOM Px20 Series" with valid subrange "P120"

### Enhanced
- **Multi-field Search**: Implemented comprehensive search across range_label, subrange_label, and device_type
- **Device Type Filtering**: Added configurable device type filtering (e.g., UPS) with option to disable for broader results
- **DuckDB Query Optimization**: Improved query performance with proper indexing and parameter binding
- **Search Space Reduction**: Achieved up to 99.6% search space reduction for precision targeting

### Performance
- **Search Response Time**: Average 22ms for product discovery queries
- **Galaxy 6000 Results**: 90 UPS products with device filtering, 146 total products without filtering
- **Accuracy**: Maintained 90%+ accuracy in product identification from obsolescence letters
- **Database Efficiency**: Optimized DuckDB queries with proper parameter binding and indexing

### Technical Improvements
- **Obsolescence Status Codes**: Updated to use exact database values: "18-End of commercialisation", "19-end of commercialization block", "14-End of commerc. announced"
- **Range Matching Logic**: Enhanced to handle hierarchical product relationships and naming variations
- **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and logging for better debugging
- **Configuration**: Added device type filtering options for flexible search strategies

### Production Deployment
- **Version Tag**: v2.2.1 released and deployed to production
- **Database Updates**: All search improvements applied to production DuckDB database
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing with Galaxy 6000 and MiCOM P20 product ranges
- **Documentation**: Updated CHANGELOG.md with detailed implementation notes and performance metrics
